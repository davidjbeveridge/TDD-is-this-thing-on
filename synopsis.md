Is this thing on? Testing JavaScript, 1, 2, 3.
================================================================================

Test-Driven Developmen: Some love it, some hate it, and most just think it's for
neckbearded ruby hipsters.

In this talk, David Beveridge will discuss what TDD is, what it's *not*, and
will show you how to *think* TDD and do it with JavaScript. We'll have some
discussion, and watch David fumble his way through some code, hopefully making
every mistake in the book. You might even learn something.

David is the JavaScript Platform Architect at
[Originate](http://www.originate.com), a close-knit team of designers,
developers, and product strategists located across 8 global offices. He lives
and works remotely from Colorado Springs.
